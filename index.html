<p>
After spending many years as a graphic designer, I decided it was time to look at something new.  I have always had a passion for technology, and looking into building software seemed like a natural fit.  After some research, I decided to go the route of Mobile Development, as it would let me use that extensive background in design while learning to develop software.  

<br><br>

At that point I started the degree program for Mobile Development at Full Sail University. It was an accelerated program and some of the key points that we focused on were designing for mobile, building native iOS and Android applications, as well as the planning for creation and marketing of mobile applications.
